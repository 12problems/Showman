# Showman
A mod for Balatro that allows for seed analysis to be performed in-game.

You simply open the Settings, go to the Showman tab, and choose which ante you would like to check the shop for, how far into the shop you want to search, and if the analysis should perform as if you have the Showman joker (regardless if you own it at the moment, just so you can see repeats for the sake of owning a Showman).

This mod was inspired by the tool The Soul (https://spectralpack.github.io/TheSoul/). I like this tool for preparing seeded runs; however, it not being in game can be a pain, and the UI is not super user friendly to searching deep into the shop for multiple things.

Current plans:

- Make base functionality work (done?)
  - Fix bug where page buttons don't update when they should (annoying af, reversing ui elements takes forever)
- Add support to find and track (pin to main UI?) jokers in the shop.
- Add support for shop packs, vouchers, etc
  - Maybe find a way to view results of skip tag jokers? (specifically uncommon/rare as edition tags apply to the next joker)


I want to thank Balatro University for being a partial inspiration for me making this mod, and for all of the great content he puts out. Without you, Doc, I would not have the same love for this game that I do. 

Also a special thanks to the creators of the Brainstorm mod which was heavily influencial as source material for both creating a mod from scratch and touching RNG elements.
